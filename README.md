# Project03 – Calculus in Data Science

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates how **Calculus** is applied in Data Science, focusing on **Gradient Descent** – an optimization technique to minimize errors in machine learning models.  
We compare our **manual gradient descent implementation** with **Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression**.

---

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Import dataset (`sample_data.csv`)
2. Implement Gradient Descent manually
3. Visualize cost function reduction
4. Compare results with Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Results
- Gradient Descent successfully minimized cost  
- Sklearn coefficients matched our implementation closely  
- Plots show convergence of the model
